# CLASS LVDM
This is the modification of the CLASS code v1.7 that incorporates the cosmological model of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) in gravity and dark matter, presented in arXiv:1209.0464. This code was used in the paper arXiv:1410.6514.
Compared to the usual CLASS code, it containts 4 new parameters (see arXiv:1410.6514 for more detail):

* alpha, beta, lambda - charachterize LV in the gravity sector
* Y - charachterizes LV in the dark matter sector

In order to use the code, download the .zip file and add the file bessels.dat into the folder. If you use this code for your research, please cite the papers arXiv:1209.0464 and arXiv:1410.6514, which contain the description of the model.
